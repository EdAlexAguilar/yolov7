# Fork of Official YOLOv7, modified for simplistic modular use

## Simplistic Use Readme
Modified implementation made to be installable.
me functionalities have been removed here, so not eveyrthing will work. In particular, this was tested with the weights found in [**YOLOv7**](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt)



``` shell
# 1) clone this fork
# 2) source your virtual environment
# 3) go to the root of this project and install
pip install -e .
# 4) Download the yolov7.pt weights and place in yolov7/yolov7 folder

```
Note: the requirements in setup.py don't have pytorch, In order to avoid issues with GPU support, it is better to install separately.
